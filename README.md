# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello world, I am creating a site on GitHub for the sake of my hobby alongside studying IT in College.

I want to learn HTML/CSS alongside bootstrap and javascript and then lead on to learning Java and Python or C#/.NET within my languages.

I am currently in the 2nd Year of my study at the College and hope to go into HND-Apprenticeship next year in an IT company as well as benefiting myself as much as I can during the time coming up to a job.

Special thanks to Ross Brown and Daniel Nash.
